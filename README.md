# anomaly-detection

Videos captured are mostly non-stationary in nature. To handle such non-stationarity nature, we propose a prediction framework using time recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on UCSD and UMN datasets.
